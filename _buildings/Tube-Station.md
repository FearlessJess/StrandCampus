layout: tube
architecture: At the junction between Strand and Surrey Street, there is an abandoned building called Aldwych station. It has been shut for almost three decades. Although the entrance is hard to discover, this station has been awarded Grade II listing as a preserved building in the UK. The front of the architecture has an Edwardian Baroque house style.  It is tiled with oxblood faience produced by the corporation Leeds Fireclay.  The interior space features mauve granolithic flooring, clad lifts and wooden ticket windows.

history: Built from 1907, this station served as a shuttle route to Holborn as a part of Piccadilly Line. It was called the Strand at the very first, but renamed Aldwych in 1915. It used to be popular in 1919, when it was commented by the press as “London’s coolest spot”.<br><br>During the Second World War, the transport service to Holborn was temporarily closed. From 1940 to 1945, the station was officially used a shelter for more than 2500 people. Museums and governments also placed artistic collections in the empty tunnel to shelter from bombings. The little station became a symbol of national unity in wartime.Since 1952, Aldywch station has become a famous filming scene. For example, THE GENTLE GUNMAN (1952) and PICCADILLY THIRD STOP (1960). However, the number of passengers remained at a very low level because of the poor transport planning. The station was finally closed in 1993.

function: Today, the station is a heritage of London transport. It is still used as a filming scene. People can visit it during the guided trip of London Transport Museum.
