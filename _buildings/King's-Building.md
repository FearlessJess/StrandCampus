history: King's Building, originally known as the College Building, was designed by Sir Robert Smirke at the College's founding in 1829. It was constructed between 1829 and 1831 on land provided by the Government to King's College to complete the riverbank frontage of Somerset House.In 1828-1829, a group of prominent politicians, churchmen, and others founded King's College London. They desired a Church of England alternative to University College London (UCL, founded in 1826). King's and UCL were the two founding colleges of the University of London founded in 1836.As the founding building, King’s building has a direct view of the Thames and is located halfway between the Houses of Parliament and St Paul's Cathedral, close to Somerset House and the Courtauld Institute of Art, and across the road from the Royal Courts of Justice.
Strand-Entrance: The Strand Building is longitudinally adjacent to the King’s Building and is more like the facade of King’s, serving as a reception. Usually most students and staff enter the King’s Building through the Strand Entrance. It takes up a relatively small area and contains a parenting room, first aid room and prayer room. 
Old-Entrance-Hall1: The Old Entrance Hall is on the ground floor. There were 2 statues standing on two sides, Sappho and Sophocles. They were presented to King's by the executors of Mrs Frida Mond(1847-1923) and had been standing in the Mond London home's front hall.The 2 sculptures are linked to King's motto, sancte et sapienter, which means "with holiness and wisdom." 
Old-Entrance-Hall2: Reggie，the official mascot of King's College London Students' Union, officially adopted in 1923, was almost 100 years old. It has endured World War II and also been “kidnapped” from King’s a few times by UCL students and other universities.
Great-Hall: On the opposite of the Old Entrance Hall is the Great Hall, a part of the university's foundation structure, which was built between 1829 and 1831. King's had renounced the free services of Sir John Nash, architect of Buckingham Palace, in favour of those of Sir Robert Smirke, architect of the British Museum, to manifest the prestige of the project.  <br/><br/>The Great Hall is one of the King's Building's main congregational areas and many ancient elements and styles were kept during previous refurbishment, such as oak panelling, joinery, the King's crest,  paint and wood stain colours. It is now being used for a range of events, such as banqueting, receptions, career fairs as well as guest lectures with a capacity of  300 maximum standing, 240 theatre style and 150 banquet style. Prime ministers, UN Secretary General Kodi Annan and Prince Harry have all been invited here. However,it is usually closed on normal days.
Chapel1: The Chapel is on the first floor, right above the Great Hall. The other chapel in King’s is the Chapel of Thomas Guy on Guy's Campus. This is a magnificent example of Victorian architecture designed by George Gilbert Scott.  
Chapel2: The Chapel has been refurbished several times in history. When the original College building by Robert Smirke was finished in 1831, it had a chapel in the same location as the current one. The College Council approved a request by the College Chaplain to rebuild the original chapel in 1859, stating that it was unworthy of King's because of its "meagreness and poverty". Later, Gilbert Scott was approved to renovate and the refurbishment was finished in 1864. In 2001, it received a £750,000 renovation to restore it to its former splendour. For a fuller history and more details about the architecture, you can read A Brief History of King’s College Chapel at the Strand, The definitive history of the College Chapel written by Gordon Huelin FKC or visit King’s website. 
CHapel3: Now, the remarkable Chapel still works as a sacred place for staff and students to visit, pray, and medicate, and also used by King’s world-renowned choir. It is a pure land for hearts to rest. Regular services are open to all staff, students and public visitors, regardless of faith or personal convictions.
Council-Room: The Council Room and the Old Committee Room of the College are both located here, having hosted some of King's College most important occasions and utilised for College Committee meetings and VIP parties. Many prior Principals and Deans are depicted in paintings in the Old Committee Room.
