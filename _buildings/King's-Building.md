history: King's Building, originally known as the College Building, was designed by Sir Robert Smirke at the College's founding in 1829. It was constructed between 1829 and 1831 on land provided by the Government to King's College to complete the riverbank frontage of Somerset House.In 1828-1829, a group of prominent politicians, churchmen, and others founded King's College London. They desired a Church of England alternative to University College London (UCL, founded in 1826). King's and UCL were the two founding colleges of the University of London founded in 1836.As the founding building, King’s building has a direct view of the Thames and is located halfway between the Houses of Parliament and St Paul's Cathedral, close to Somerset House 1 and the Courtauld Institute of Art, and across the road from the Royal Courts of Justice.
architecture:
Strand Building: The Strand Building is longitudinally adjacent to the King’s Building and is more like the facade of King’s, serving as a reception. Usually most students and staff enter the King’s Building through the Strand Entrance. It takes up a relatively small area and contains a parenting room, first aid room and prayer room. Old Entrance Hall:The Old Entrance Hall has 2 statues standing on two sides, Sappho and Sophocles. They were presented to King's by the executors of Mrs Frida Mond(1847-1923) and had been standing in the Mond London home's front hall.The 2 sculptures are linked to King's motto, sancte et sapienter, which means "with holiness and wisdom." Reggie, the official mascot of King's College London Students' Union, officially adopted in 1923, was almost 100 years old. It has endured World War II and also been “kidnapped” from King’s a few times by UCL students and other universities. https://www.kcl.ac.uk/reggie-is-stolen-the-early-years-1926-1938
