history: Long before the very Maughan Library existed, the first building that stood on the site was the House of the Converts, a residence and chapel for Jewish people who had converted to Christianity in the thirteenth century. After that, in 1290, the Master of the Rolls became warden and consequently, the chapel was regarded as Rolls Chapel, which became, together with the House, the office of the Keeper of the Rolls from 1377, where stored rolls and records of the Court of Chancery. Eventually, the medieval chapel of the building was incorporated into a new Rolls House and in 1837, it was surrendered to the Crown. The Weston Room was part of the Rolls Chapel, has preserved some features such as stained glass windows, mosaic floor, etc. Now it is the oldest section of the Maughan Library.<br/><br/>The original building of the Maughan Library was used as Public Record Office after its completion of construction. Owing to the dedicating function, which is, to house effectively and safely all the documents and records of the country, the building followed rather specific architectural design and attributes principles, known as the “strong-box of the Empire”. To minimize the fire risk, all the storage cell rooms were designed to be self-contained with cast-iron heavy doors. Currently, the original cells with such characteristics can be found in rooms G38 and LG72.<br/><br/>The dodecagonal reading room was added in 1863 and it was a work inspired by the larger Round Reading Room at the British Museum. It is featured with a rare painted zinc dome ceiling, the same material shared with the ceiling of the lobby entrance.
architecture: The Maughan Library was designed by Sir James Pennethorne and was constructed in 1851, with further extension works carried out between 1868 and 1900, which can be observed from the varying shades of stones used at different times that formed the current façade of the buildings. The stones were mainly quarried from the British sites of Anston, Portland and Mansfield.<br/><br/>The library is situated at Chancery Lane London and is just a 10-minute walk from the Strand Campus of King’s College London. It’s an architectural gem of Gothic Revival style and a Grade II listed building. As a building of historical significance, although it was finished in the mid-nineteenth century, some parts of the library date back to hundreds of years ago. There’re some rooms that still preserved the old-time appearance, such as Weston Room and some original cells. Other than that, the dodecagonal reading room (also ‘the Round Room’) is also a well-known featured part of the building.
function: The building was acquired by the university in 2001 and named after Sir Deryck Maughan, a past graduate of King's, and his wife Lady Maughan—important benefactors of the college. It became the largest new university library in Britain since World War II. In the present time, the Maughan Library houses collections within the fields of Humanities, Law and Sciences, etc. as well as more than 1000 study spaces including Group Study rooms, Computer Rooms, Postgraduate Zones, Assistive Technology rooms and a Wellbeing Room. The Weston Room, before the medieval chapel, now an exhibition space showcasing the special collections of the library.
