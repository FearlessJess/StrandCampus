architecture: Located between the Strand and Aldwych in London City, Bush House is perhaps one of the most prominent places in King's strand campus. As an antique building with nearly one-centry history, it has been preserved under the  Grade II listed criteria of UK government. The building plan was directed by a US businessman named Irving T. Bush, hence the name. He intended to set it as a trade centre, where manufacturers could demonstrate their commodities to customers. US architect Harvey Wiley Corbett undertook the design. The initial construction started in 1919. Various parts were finished and opened over a decade, including Centre Block (1925), North-West Wing (1928), North-East Wing (1929), South-East Wing (1930) and South-West Wing (1935). Build from Portland Stone, this grand project cost around $10 million. Bush House used to be "the most expensive building in the world".<br/><br/>The central block features architecting details of the opulent complex. Facing north and overlooking Kingsway, a 100-foot arch is the main entrance of this building. It has two male statues raising a torch, with a well-known inscription over doorway, "To the friendship of the English Speaking Peoples". The statues represent UK and US in memory of the "Anglo-Saxonism" partnership from late 19th to early 20th century. 

history: Bush House was one part of the complete remodelling of this area of London in the decades around 1900, which replaced an area of slum housing and trade in pornography in the notorious Holywell Street. These developments created an imposing new business district centred around the newly-constructed Kingsway, with its revolutionary tram subway, and the semi-circular Aldwych (named after Wych Street which used to cross the area), both opened by King Edward VII in 1905. <br/><br/>The site was home to the ‘Eagle Hut’ during the First World War, established by four American businessmen and run by the Young Men Christian’s Association (YMCA). The Eagle Hut provided a place for British and American servicemen to eat, drink, and fraternise while they were stationed in London. Today, the Eagle Hut is commemorated by a plaque on Bush House which contends, notably, that the Eagle Hut’s services ‘testified to the friendship of the English speaking peoples. <br/><br/> During Second World War, a bomb hit Bush House and destoryed the left arm of the statue US. However, its right arm remained connected to the statue Britain. Until 1977 the lost arm was fixed by a US company. <br/><br/>Just in the wartime, BBC moved into Bush House and owned this place for next 70 years. The former office at Oxford Street was destroyed, BBC European services were re-located there in 1940, and overseas services arrived in the late 1950s.The world famous author George Orwell used to work in Bush House when he joined in BBC Eastern Service. It is said that the canteen and Room 101 in his book 1984  were related to some rooms in Bush House. 

function: After the thorough renovation, Bush House was announced to be an expansion of King's College London Strand Campus in 2015. Since the foundation of Business School, the long-history building has being home to King's students and staff. It also houses student's union with other spaces such as Union Shop, Arcade and activity lobbies. The courtyard, which was the car parking in BBC, is nowadays a semi-public area connecting the wings. It features a fancy glass pavilion with access to campus kitchen and bar.
