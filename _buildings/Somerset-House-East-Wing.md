title: Somerset House East Wing
layout: somerset
history: The Somerset House is a former royal palace, one of London's most elegant and historic buildings where Queen Elizabeth the First has lived before she was queen. The East Wing is on the right side of King’s building, separated by the Quad. King's College London and the Somerset House trust struck an agreement in December 2009 to purchase the East Wing of Somerset House. Finally, King’s has moved into the East Wing 180 years after its founding on the Strand. It was formally inaugurated by Her Majesty The Queen on February 29, 2012 and became King's College London's another new entrance door.   <br/><br/>The East Wing of Somerset House has extended the Strand Campus and provides high-quality space for King’s teaching and research, making it an essential aspect of King's long-term growth. 
architecture:
The-East-Wing: The East Wing of Somerset House was reopened after an 18-month renovation that began in 2009 after King’s obtained a 78-year lease on the building. The interior design was precisely prepared to complement the historic environment of the structure. Colors have been reinstated in keeping with the Georgian architecture, but also offering a new and modern interior suited for a twenty-first-century functioning structure. The construction has been repaired to the greatest standards, with architectural harmony improved and public access extended, and it has been returned to its historic function as a prominent London public building. 
The-Archaeology-Room: which contains a very comprehensive cross-section of the site's history, is a fascinating element of this lovely structure.This historical site depicts five periods of London's history:&nbsp;Saxon and early medieval (7th-8th and 12th-13th centuries), Later medieval (14th-15th century), Tudor to 18th century, Late 18th century forward, and World War 2. (1939-45).   <br/><br/>The remnants visible were unearthed during the refurbishment of Somerset House's East Wing for King’s College London in 2010, as you can see from the glass floor. Much more was discovered but not all of it could be disclosed.  <br/><br/>The timber beams along the walls, which have been brought here for show purposes, were erected in the basement during World War 2. They were employed for strengthening work to help prevent the building from further damage after two bombs landed nearby
function: The East Wing currently serves as a spectacular setting for the newly established Dickson Poon School of Law (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/law). Inside the building, there are study and lecture spaces for law students. Outside the building, a skating rink has been established on the central square of Somerset House with several restaurants around it, which is a good place for relaxing and entertaining.You can have an online visit on [King's website](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/visit/somerset-house-east-wing)
